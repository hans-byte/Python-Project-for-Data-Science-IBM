Welcome to this Python Project!  

In this project I demonstrate basic Python skills that I have acquired during my journey to become an IBM Data Scientist.

During this process I performed specific tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard. 

Thanks and hope you enjoy it!! ;)
